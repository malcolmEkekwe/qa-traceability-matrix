# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

This repository contains an example requirements traceability matrix linking high-level requirements to test cases and discovered defects for the ShopStack application.

The matrix helps ensure that each requirement is covered by at least one test case and that any defects are traced back to a requirement.
